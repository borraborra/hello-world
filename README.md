# hello-world
My first repository 
My name is Ryan Borra, and I live in Pittsburgh, PA. I am originally from Detroit, MI, but moved to Pittsburgh for work about five years ago. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Industrial design from the University of Michigan and my MBA from Baker College. I started programming a couple of years ago, beginning with HTML and CSS customizing mobile and web applications. Last year I decided to further develop my programming background by enrolling in python courses through Coursera. Currently, I am enrolled in Cornell University's Python and Data Science certificate program. As for my career, I've been working in staffing for about eight years now, specializing in robotics, mobile/web application, data science, and IoT. I'm looking forward to connecting!
